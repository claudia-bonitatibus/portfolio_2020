        DogEared is a rebrand and redesign of Audible's audiobook service that makes it easier to bookmark areas of text and share progress across devices. There is an emphasis on interaction design so that the user receives visual feedback as they navigate throughout the pages of the app.
        <br><br>
        In order to find a way to improve the user experience and design a product that sets itself apart from similar services, I had to take a step back and do competitive analysis and user research. In terms of competitive analysis I found that as far as Audible's service goes, the ability to share progress across devices and record notes was only added as an afterthought, which is why I made addressing that part of the taskflow my priority. In order to fully rebrand, I decided on a target demographic and wrote job stories so that I could address what they need in my designs.
