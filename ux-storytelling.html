        I conceptualized a service that allows users to be more active participants in the creation of design standards and made an informational video ad. All assets were made in adobe illustrator and animations were done in keynote and adobe after effects.

        The point of the project was to come up with a need that we see in the world around us, identify a target audience, take a closer look at each niche's needs, and take a look at how they can be addressed in an accesible and clear way. This process began with writing job stories for three different products demonstrating five different use cases of the products and from there choosing what to focus on for the final. The approach to creating the project incorporated a combination of standard storytelling techniques, animation practices, and UX strategy documentation. Some of these methods included identifying our hero and villain, creating a journey map as well as a map of the plot points, storyboarding, and script writing.
