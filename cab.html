      <p class="image-description">
        I have been a member of the Marketing Committee on Drexel's Campus Activities Board from June of 2018 to June 2020. Since CAB is the largest student run event planning organizations on campus, we were able to construct a team to focus specifically on student outreach. This meant we had to think about our brand, what sets our events apart and what strategies we could use to promote student engagement in our events through visual assets that could be posted on social media outlets and hung up around campus. 
        <br><br>
        During 2018 and 2019, I created posters for a variety of events. Designing for the different types of events gave me the opportunity to apply what I have learned about user-centered design to address the needs of different niches and create graphics that accurately represent the tone of the events. It also gave me a lot of practice in creating vector graphics, composing color schemes, and utilizing custom fonts. I put all of this new knowledge to use while I was Marketing Director by applying it to my critiques of my design team's poster and digital asset drafts.
